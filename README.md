### Description
OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world. Rather than the map itself, the data generated by the project is considered its primary output. The creation and growth of OSM has been motivated by restrictions on use or availability of map information across much of the world, and the advent of inexpensive portable satellite navigation devices. OSM is considered a prominent example of volunteered geographic information.

### Usage
System required:  
AWS Instance - .NET Core 2.1 with Ubuntu Server 18.04 - Version 1.0  
* Our system does not require .NET support. So, although this system has prebuilt .NET Core, it still can be seen as a blank instance.
